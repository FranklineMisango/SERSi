# SERSi
This project aims to develop a segmentation model that can predict the albedo of exoplanets based on NASA's data. Albedo is an important property of a planet that measures the fraction of incoming solar radiation that is reflected by the planet's surface and atmosphere. Accurately predicting albedo can provide valuable insights into the planet's climate, composition, and potential habitability.

## Training Data
The primary data source for this project is the NASA Exoplanet Archive (https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/). This archive contains a wealth of information on known exoplanets, including their physical characteristics, orbital parameters, and observational data.
* Exoplanet Composite Parameters: This dataset includes information on the physical properties of exoplanets, such as radius, mass, and albedo.
* Exoplanet Host Star Parameters: This dataset provides information on the host stars of the exoplanets, including their temperature, luminosity, and other relevant characteristics.
* Exoplanet Observational Data: This dataset contains the observational data used to detect and characterize the exoplanets, such as transit photometry and radial velocity measurements.
